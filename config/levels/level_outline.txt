number of suns (int N)
char P (polar coordinates from centre) or R (rectangular coordinates from top-left corner)
if Polar,
	specify x_offset, y_offset (of polar origin from centre of screen)
color	radius	theta(in degrees)	curr_level	max_level 	(N such rows for N suns)
followed by an N X N binary adjacency matrix of edges between suns along which CPU dots can move
