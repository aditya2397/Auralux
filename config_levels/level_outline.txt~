int of number of suns
char P or R
P -> polar coordinates from centre
R -> rectangular coordinates from top-left corner
followed by description of n suns
each description contains:

(for rectangular)
color (BLUE - 1, ORANGE - 3, GREEN - 5, PURPLE - 7)
2) float a and b coordinates as where x = SCREEN_WIDTH * a and y = SCREEN_WIDTH * b (0 < a, b < 1)
3) curr_level and max_level

(for polar)
x and y offset at the beginning
color radius theta(in degrees) curr_level max_level --- for each sun

(for both)
followed by an n X n adjacency matrix of edges between suns along which CPU dots can move
